### What are Reference Implementations?

Reference Implementations are pre-configured software examples built on S-CORE to demonstrate best practices and integration patterns. They serve as a starting point for new projects and as a proof-of-concept for S-CORE’s capabilities.

### Available Reference Implementations

- **Digital Cockpit Reference:** An in-vehicle infotainment system demonstrating how S-CORE manages display, input, and multimedia through open APIs.
- **ADAS Safety Reference:** An advanced driver-assistance setup showcasing S-CORE’s safety features and real-time data handling for sensor fusion.
- **Powertrain Control Reference:** A mock powertrain control module illustrating how S-CORE can be used in powertrain and vehicle dynamics scenarios.

Each reference implementation comes with source code and documentation. Developers can experiment with them to learn how to structure their own S-CORE-based applications.
