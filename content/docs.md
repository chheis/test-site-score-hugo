## Build & Documentation Toolchain

The build system uses Bazel to automate workflows like repository setup, building, and testing across multiple packages. Documentation is generated using Sphinx and is available on the project website.

- **Build Scripts:** Located under `/build/` directory â€“ these scripts set up the build container and toolchains.
- **Documentation:** Source files are in `/docs/`; after building, the documentation can be viewed as a website or PDF.
