## From Proprietary To Open Source

The industry has long tackled software challenges independently – often duplicating efforts and building closed, incompatible systems.  

S-CORE changes this by uniting OEMs, suppliers and developers around a common SW-platform. The goal of S-CORE is to reduce duplication and foster collaboration in automotive software development.

## What is S-CORE?

S-CORE (Safety – Community – Open Runtime Engine) is an open-source software framework for safety-critical automotive applications. It provides a standardized platform that abstracts hardware complexity and offers common services for automotive software components. By leveraging S-CORE, organizations can focus on innovation rather than re-solving foundational issues.

## Why Open Source for Automotive?

Open source collaboration accelerates development and ensures quality through community engagement. S-CORE is built in the open to encourage:
- **Collaboration:** Shared development of core software.
- **Speed:** Faster integration of new features.
- **Quality:** Community review and testing.
- **Safety:** Collective focus on functional safety requirements.

By moving from proprietary silos to an open ecosystem, the automotive industry can innovate faster and create interoperable systems.
